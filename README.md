## Architecture-

The food delivery app is built using the MERN stack. The app consists of several components, including the Home screen, My Orders screen, Cart screen, log in, and Logout screen. 

The app is designed to be scalable and modular, with a clean and organized codebase. The backend API is implemented using Express.js and Mongoose, with separate controllers and models for each component. The front end is implemented using React, with separate components for each screen and functionality.

## Design-

The app's design is modern and user-friendly, with an emphasis on simplicity and ease of use. With a black background and basic font, the app has a clean and minimalist style. The webÂ application also employs concise and clear language, with simple labeling and instructions.

The Home screen offers a list of food products, as well as a search bar and settings for the number of items to be ordered. The Home screen displays the menu's items and allows the user to add them to their cart. The Cart page displays the user's cart contents and allows the user to place an order. The Order screen displays the user's order information.
